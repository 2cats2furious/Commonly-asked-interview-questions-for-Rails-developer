# Commonly asked interview questions for junior Rails developer

This book organizes some common interview questions for junior Rails developer. I wrote this book for preparing my interview and also try to understand more for each important concept.

Writing something down and trying to teach others are always the best ways to learn. Since I am not a senior and not yet extremely professional, some concept I wrote may not be precise. If you are not sure the concepts, for most of the posts there are reference resources under the post. You can check it out or research more by your own.

 Any PR and feedback is welcome. I hope this book can help you gain more ideas about Rails and Ruby.



I basically separate this book for three part, Basic, Intermediate and Advanced based on the difficulty and how often those questions are asked.
